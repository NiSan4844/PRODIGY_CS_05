## Overview

The Packet Sniffer Tool is designed to help users understand network traffic by capturing packets that pass through a specified network interface. It utilizes the Scapy library to sniff packets and extract information such as:

- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Protocol type (TCP, UDP, etc.)
- Payload data (if available)

This tool is useful for educational purposes, including learning about network protocols and analyzing network behavior.

## Usage

1. **Run as Administrator**: To capture packets, run the script with administrative privileges. For Windows system, right-click on your command prompt or terminal and select "Run as administrator." For Linux system, run the python script using `sudo` command.

2. **Specify Network Interface**: You can capture packets on a specific interface by modifying the `network_interface` variable in the script. List available interfaces using Scapy with the following command:

   ```python
   from scapy.all import get_if_list
   print(get_if_list())
   ```

3. **Execute the Script**: Run the packet sniffer script using Python:

   ```bash
   python packet_sniffer.py
   ```

4. **View Output**: The tool will display captured packet information in the console.

## Features

- Capture and analyze network packets in real time.
- Display source and destination IP addresses.
- Identify protocol types (TCP, UDP, etc.).
- Preview payload data when available.

## Future Improvements

- **Logging**: Implement logging functionality to save captured packets to a file for later analysis.
- **GUI**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Add options for advanced filtering based on specific protocols, ports, or IP addresses.
- **Multi-threading**: Optimize the packet capturing process by implementing multi-threading for improved performance.
- **Visualization**: Integrate data visualization tools to graphically represent captured traffic.
